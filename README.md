# 🚧 Road Accident Severity Analysis

A data analysis and machine learning project focused on understanding and predicting the severity of road accidents. This project explores how different features such as **state name**, **driver seat count**, and **speed limit** contribute to the severity level of accidents (Minor, Serious, Fatal).

---

## 📊 Project Objective

To analyze the road accident dataset and apply machine learning models to classify accident severity into three categories:
- **Minor**
- **Serious**
- **Fatal**

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Dataset not specified, placeholder]
- **Rows**: ~3000
- **Features Used for Modeling**:
  - `State_Name`
  - `Driver_seat`
  - `Speed_limit`

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values and data imbalance
- Visualized distributions of severity by features
- Encoded categorical variables for ML compatibility
